The Ultimate Pub Quiz is an exciting development designed specifically for pub users and activity coordiators. Based on the principles of a "traditional Friday night pub quiz", the Ultimate Pub quiz is a way of having that same fun, only without the hastle of organising it. 

## User Experience
### Background

The Ultimate Pub Quiz is designed for pub users and activity coordinators and is a way for all participants to enjoy the same experience of a traditional pub quiz. It's an online quiz that users can access by using a range of devices, although they will be limited to smart devices (e.g. laptops. tablets, smart phones).

This quiz has been developed based on a real need - a good friend who is also a pub landlord  - for an exciting experience without the hastle of having someone try to organise it. 

The quiz has several aims:

- Engage pub users
- Suitabily challenge users
- Respond to user input
- Provide feedback
- Provide a final score. 
- Display record of previous high scores 

### Key information

- A 'How to play' section, which will give users instructions on how to play the game
- A 'High Scores' section, which will display a list of the highest scores in descending order
- The quiz itself

### About the user

This project has been designed with two end users in mind:

- The pub user, who is the user participating in the quiz. They will be able to access the quiz via a smart device through their own internet or Wifi of the premises, if they have it. Part of the 'How to Play' instructions will be guiding users how to switch on their device wi-fi, or hotspot to another device. They will be given a 'Room ID' that they must enter along wth their name when they join the quiz. They will be given the Room ID by the faciltator. The instructions will need to be clear. 

- The organiser, who is the person who will be facilitating the event. They will already have facilitator login details and will be able to create a 'room' for the users to join. They will have the option to start the quiz once a certian number of users have joined the room. The login system will need to be quick and simple, and must give the facilitator control over starting the quiz, although ending the quiz will be automated and pausing will not be an option. 

### User Goals
The pub user:

- To receive the same user experience on multiple devices
- To read instructions that are simple to understand
- To be challenged across a range of questions
- To see my score once the quiz is over
- To compare my score with other people's scores


The facilitator:
- To be able to log on and create a 'room'
- To start the quiz at my discresion
- To see the results of the users in the room once finished
- To easily identify a winner amongst users in the room


### First Time Visitor Goals

The pub user:
- To take part in an online virtual pub quiz
- To be challenged in the right way (questions not too easy or too hard) ((!! Will solve this by choosing range of questions from range of topics))
- To view my score at the end, and be able to compare to other scores

The facilitator:
- To create a 'room' for the users to join
- To start the quiz
- To collate scores of the users


### Returning Visitor Goals

The pub user:
- To take part in an online virtual pub quiz
- To be challenged in the right way (questions not too easy or too hard)
- To not be given the same questions as I had on the last quiz, as this will present less of a challenge
- To view my score at the end, and be able to compare to other scores

The facilitator:
- To create a 'room' for the users to join
- To start the quiz
- To collate scores of the users

### Frequent Visitor Goals
