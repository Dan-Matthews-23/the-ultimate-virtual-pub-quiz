  ## The Ultimate Pub Quiz

![Am I responsive](/assets/images/responsive.png)

[View The Ultimate Pub Quiz on Github](https://dan-matthews-23.github.io/java-project/)

The Ultimate Pub Quiz is an exciting development designed specifically for pub users and activity coordiators. Based on the principles of a "traditional Friday night pub quiz", the Ultimate Pub quiz is a way of having that same fun, only without the hastle of organising it. 

## User Experience
### Background

The Ultimate Pub Quiz is designed for pub users and activity coordinators and is a way for all participants to enjoy the same experience of a traditional pub quiz. It's an online quiz that users can access by using a range of devices, although they will be limited to smart devices (e.g. laptops. tablets, smart phones).

This quiz has been developed based on a real need - a good friend who is also a pub landlord  - for an exciting experience without the hastle of having someone try to organise it. 

The quiz has several aims:

- Engage pub users
- Respond to user input
- Provide feedback
- Provide a final score. 
- Display record of previous high scores 

### Key information

- A 'How to play' section, which will give users instructions on how to play the game
- A 'High Scores' section, which will display a list of the highest scores in descending order
- The quiz itself which will allow the users to answer questions

### About the user

This project has been designed with two end users in mind:

- The pub user, who is the user participating in the quiz. They will be able to access the quiz via a smart device through their own internet or Wifi of the premises, if they have it. Part of the 'How to Play' instructions will be guiding users how to switch on their device wi-fi, or hotspot to another device. They will be given a 'Room Number' that they must enter along wth their name when they join the quiz. They will be given the Room ID by the faciltator. The instructions will need to be clear. 

- The facilitator, who is the person who will be facilitating the event. They will need to ensure everyone has the correct Room Code, and they need only advise the participants to begin at an alloted time. Once all participants have completed the quiz, the facilitator will be able to view the High Scores, which will be grouped and easy to identify a clear winner.  

### User Goals
The pub user:

- To receive the same user experience on multiple devices
- To read instructions that are simple to understand
- To be challenged across a range of questions
- To see my score once the quiz is over
- To compare my score with other scores


The facilitator:
- To see the results of the users in the room once finished
- To easily identify a winner amongst users in the room


### First Time Visitor Goals

The pub user:
- To take part in an online virtual pub quiz
- To be challenged in the right way (questions not too easy or too hard) ((!! Will solve this by choosing range of questions from range of topics))
- To view my score at the end, and be able to compare to other scores

The facilitator:
- To view scores of the users without havng to do the quiz myself
- To be able to identify a winner


### Returning Visitor Goals

The pub user:
- To take part in an online virtual pub quiz
- To be challenged in the right way (questions not too easy or too hard) ((!! Will solve this by choosing range of questions from range of topics))
- To view my score at the end, and be able to compare to other scores

The facilitator:
- To view scores of the users without havng to do the quiz myself
- To be able to identify a winner

### Frequent Visitor Goals

The pub user:
- To take part in an online virtual pub quiz
- To be challenged in the right way (questions not too easy or too hard) ((!! Will solve this by choosing range of questions from range of topics))
- To view my score at the end, and be able to compare to other scores

The facilitator:
- To view scores of the users without havng to do the quiz myself
- To be able to identify a winner

### Colour

![THE ULTIMATE QUIZ COLOUR PALETTE](/assets/images/colour-palette.webp)

[Also available as Coolors palette](https://coolors.co/1d110f-a37451-0e0807-8b5f48-67442c)

I have chosen the above colour palette from Coolors which was generated based on the background image I used. However I have slightly modified some of the shades in order to conform with contrast ratio (see #Feedback). 


### Font

 The font I have chosen to use for this project is one called Poppins, which is part of the Sans Sarif family. It can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins). I chose the 'Light 300' weighting as I felt that it would stand out a little more than the 'thin' preset. 

### Images

There is only one image used in the Virtual Pub Quiz which servves as a background image, relevent to the theme. The author is noted and is available to view in the #Credits section.


## Features

### Sections

It's important to note here that the Virtual Pub Quiz is contained on a single page that is seperated out into different sections, each hidden and displayed, or toggled, by the user (see Functions Explained for detail on how the toggle works)

#### User Selection Screen section

![User Selection Screen]()

This is the first section the user is presented with. It has three buttons that, based on user input, will take the user to one of three sections: Username, Instructions or Hall of Fame. 

#### Username section

![User Selection Screen]()

This section is where the user enteres a username and a room code. Both are input boxes and subject to validation to ensure the username is between 3 and 10 characters long, and that the room code is numeric. In practise, the room code will be available from the facilitator. The user can either choose to return to the main menu, or submit the username and room code

#### Quiz section

![User Selection Screen]()

The Quiz section is there the user is asked a question, and is given four possible answers to choose. Only one of them is correct. Guessing the correct answer will cause the score to increment by 10 and the answer being highlighted green, while guessing the incorrect answer will cause the chosen answer being highlighted red, and the correct answer highlighted yellow. Once an answer has been selected, the 'Next' button will appear. Clicking this button will cause the next question to be called from the API. This will continue until the array has reached the question limit. At any time, the user may return to the main menu.

#### Game Over section

![User Selection Screen]()

Once the user has reached the question limit, the questions will no longer display. All sections will hide and the Game Over section will display that will tell the user their final score. The suer will be presented with two options: Return to the main menu, or save their score into the Hall of Fame. 

#### Hall of Fame section

![User Selection Screen]()

The Hall of Fame section lists all saved scores. They are sorted first by Room Number and then by score. By grouping the scores by room number first it makes it easier for the facilitator to see who won the round. The user can then go back to the main menu by selecting the button, and they are taken back to the User Selection Screen section

#### Instructions

![User Selection Screen]()

This section gives the user a set of instructions on how to play the quiz. The user has the option to return to the main menu. 

#### Return to main manu

![User Selection Screen]()

This option is available to the user at every section. When clicked, the suer will be presented with a confirm box, asking the user to confirm they want to go back to the main menu, and that any progress will be lost. The user can either click 'Ok' or 'cancel' to stay on the current section. 


#### Footer

The footer incorperates external links to Facebook, Twitter, GitHub and Linked In


## Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

- Using alternative text for interactive elements within the project
- Using an accessible colour palette
- Using a clear, accesible navigation system throughout that is guided by the user
- Using semantic scripts
- Using a good contrast ratio that passes contrasting tests (see Feedback on previous projects for further infoformation)


## Justifications and reflections

-  **Play Again** -  I had originally intended on creating a Play Again option to be presented ont he Game Over modal. However I decided not to include this function in the final verion of the product due to conflicts with the user story of the facilitator. This was intended to be virtual pub quiz, and in a pub quiz, the participants are not generally allowed to subit their answers twice. Therefore I have not included this option, however it should be noted here that there must be a certain level of trust that the user will not start the quiz again but with a different username, just as there is a level of trust that the participants in a face to face will not confer with one another. To mitigate this risk as much as possible, I have set the question array limit to 100, reducing the likelhood of the same user answering the same questions as before. 

-  **Hall Of Fame list** - In an earlier version of the project I had a function that would allow the user to display all scores either by Room Number or Score by selecting from a drop-down menu and clicking a submit button. However this proved to be complex because I have opted to hide and display sections by class all on one page rather than to use modals. Because of this I could not find a way of executing the function without a submit, and when the button was clicked and the function activated, it reset the classes of every section. Instead, I have a function that sorts the high scores by order of room, then of score automaticly. That means the facilitator user stories are still met, making it easy to see who scored the most out of the room, and the participents user stories are also met by being able to see the top player. While this method was not my preferred way, it still achieves the same thing. 


- **Seperate pages for each section** - I did not include a page per section as I'd seen others do whilst doing some research, and as per my original designs. This was purely a choice of personal preference; I wanted to create something unique, and hadn't seen a quiz done on a single page in my research. In hindsight it may have been easier to create this project using seperate pages, particularly for my Hall of Fame section (as described above). My mentor had approved of this idea during one of our conferences. 

- **Facilitator login system** - Although I did not include these in my original designs, I had hoped to create a login for the facilitator so that they could create a room, then start it when all participants were ready. However after speaking to my friend (the pub owner), they highlighted that while it was a good idea in principal, in application it could prove to cause other issues. For one, it would require that the facilitator always had a live and stable internet connection, always had login details to hand and that they would have the knowledge to create a room. In addition, they highlight concern with the fact that all particpants would need to indicate they were ready before the facilitator started the room, which again assumed that all particpants would be IT-savy and have no internet conenction issues. With all of these points in mind, I decided to ommit that function completley and instead opted for a way in which all user stories would be met and that addressed all these points

- **Lack of multimedia** - I have intentioanlly ommited any additional media from this project for several reasons:

1) As this quiz was designed for a real purpose with a real-world applicaiton, I had to take into account the environment in which it would be used. With that in mind it's very unlikely that the pub user would be able to hear any background sounds due to the background noise generally associated with a pub setting.

2) It would be unreasonable to expect a pub user, who may be sharing an internet connection with all other pub users or on a limited data plan, to watch a video or have a background sound that would increase the bandwitch needed, however small

3) I did not find there was a need for any multimedia, since the user stories are all met without, and was not part of any of the assessment criterea. 

- **Background color** - While this point is relativley minor, I feel it necessary to point out that I did not intend to use brown as a background for the user screen and user screen container, as well as the answer buttons. However the colour palette was suggested by Coolors based on the background image I'd already selected, and because my eyes don't see contrasts and shades well, I felt it important to rely on that suggestion. However it should be noted that I have also taken the advice of [WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/bookmarklet) which advised me that the Coolors palette was not accessible in its current form, and so I have modified the palette slightly so that it passed all tests (see Feedback on previous projects).

- **Difficulty** - Most of the quizes I'd seen during my research incorperated a difficulty setting where the user could decide on which level they would like to be challenged. I have decided not to include this function. I wanted to keep this project as close to a atraditional pub setting as possible, and during a standard pub quiz a pub user cannot choose the difficulty. While admitadly a bit of a risk, I consulted with my friend - the end user - and they agreed that we should not include a difficulty setting due to fairness (where it would not be fair to name a winner who has completed an easier quiz than the others). 

- **Navigation bar** - I have chosen not to conform to a standard navigation bar that a user would generally expect to find on a typical website. The reasoning behind this is that this project, being a quiz, was designed with the elements in mind that a user would find on almost any interactive quiz, therefore the navigation across the quiz comes from buttons that display the relevent sections.

## Testing

Please see [Testing Readme](/TESTING.md) for all testing for this project


## Feedback

### Peer Feedback

I have worked closely with my peers on testing this product rigorously for any errors. The feedback is as follows:

1) How many questions do you have on your quiz? I've got to four and the game just stops with no errors or alerts

2) When you get correct answer it changes to just 40 then you click next and get score 40, might be better to keep score alongside he number when answer correct.

3) Your scores aren't working when I completed the quiz

4) On your instructions on mobile use overflow: scroll

5) Your back to main menu buttons are giving me a 404 error

6) What happens if there's a draw? Should you not have a bonus round?


### Responding to Peer Feedback

I have taken the following actions in response to feedback:

1) For this particular error I have used a function I found on  [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/decoding-html-entities-with-vanilla-javascript/). It puts the value of the correct answer into a blank text box then pulls it back out in order to format, or decode, the value of the variable. 

2) I have amended the increaseScore function output to return "Score: ${score} rather than just the value of score. 

3) I have re-designed the Game Over modal to include a final high score which is clear

4) I have corrected the issue with main container that was causing the content to spill out 

5) I have ameded the code where ordinarily the user would be directed to ("index.html") which is designed for localhost, not for external hosting

6) Some facilitators allow joint winners in a standard pub quiz. Also, I spoke to my friend (the pub owner) about this who said that facilitators often come prepared with activities, rather than questions, in the event of a tie. With this in mind, I felt it important not to take away that option, and so I have not acted upon this feedback. 


### Feedback from previous projects

I received several peices of feedback on my Heart Helpers project from my facilitarors. These were:

1) Background and foreground are clear and easy to read however, <u>in the future contrast ratio could be cross check during the design stage. (alt text has been used in the code)</u>

2) There are fewer spaces or capitalisation in the file <u>cross check for future development</u>

3) Clearly evidence the testing process for both unit testing and final usability testing. Test logs are included in the readme file to access functionality, usability and responsiveness. <u>For further development do include screenshots of actual result of tests</u>

4) Learners has presented code is well-organised and easy to follow. The finished project has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing the needs of a particular target audience.  <u>For further development make use of code and screen shots in readme file for development stages</u>

5) Some documentation has been completed throughout development as shown in readme although further and detail documentation is required 

### Responding to feedback from previous projects


I have taken the following actions in response to feedback:

1) Because I am partially colour-blind, I've had to build this project using a tool called (WebAIM)[] to aid me in checking contrast ratio. I continue to use alternative text, however I have also made the following adjustments to my Coolers template. The adjustments pass all validator tests and can be found in the Design section:

- Answer Buttons: Background: #9A6A4C, text: #FFFFFF
![678px ratio](/assets/testing/contrast-ratio-a.png

- Game Over Modal: Background: #1D110F, text: #a37451
![678px ratio](/assets/testing/contrast-ratio-b.png

 - Score Section: Background: #1D110F, text: #a37451
 ![678px ratio](/assets/testing/contrast-ratio-c.png

 I have also included a WAVE report which passes all tests


2) I have ensured that every filename contains no numbers, capital letters or underscores. Each file has been placed in an appropiate folder, and I've ensured each file is named correctly and appropiatly. 

3) I have ensured that along with details of all of my testing, I've included as many before and after screenshots as possible. In some cases it wasn't always possible to include both, but these tests are clearly marked with justification

4) Throughout the testing stages I have included snippets of code along with screenshots of visual output of that code. 

5) I have attempted to be as thorough as possible throughout development of this project.

### Other Feedback

My mentor - Harry - suggested that instead of creating four seperate HTML documents as planned in my wireframes, that I create one single page and then use Javascript to hide and show the sections I want. To that end, I have created a series of Event Listeners that will execute blocks of code when the correct button is clicked. In this context, it will show/hide parts of the page since the entire product exists in one document. 



## Functions explained

The following section will explain in detail how each function works. All functions can be found in /assets/js/script.js. This section has been written with the aid of [Google Bard](https://bard.google.com/) and checked thoroughly for errors. 


|      Function   |   Explanation    |
| ------------    | ------------     |
|  connectAPI()   |  The JavaScript function connectAPI() is an async function that makes a request to the API specified by the apiURL parameter. The function first uses the fetch() method to make the request. The fetch() method returns a promise, which is a special object that represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The connectAPI() function then uses the await keyword to wait for the promise to be resolved. Once the promise is resolved, the function checks the status code of the response. If the status code is between 200 and 299, the function parses the response as JSON and calls the getQuestionArray() function. Otherwise, the function redirects the user to the 500.html page. |
|  checkUsername()   |  The JavaScript function checkUsername() is a function that checks the validity of a username. The function first gets the value of the username input field using the document.getElementById() method. The value property of the getElementById() method returns the value of the element with the specified ID. Next, the function checks if the username is empty, less than 3 characters long, or more than 10 characters long using the following conditional statements: username.length === 0: This checks if the username is empty, username.length > 0 && username.length < 3: This checks if the username is more than 0 characters long but less than 3 characters long and username.length > 10: This checks if the username is more than 10 characters long. If any of the above conditions are met, the function displays an alert message that tells the user to enter a valid username. Otherwise, the function hides the username section and shows the quiz section. |
|  checkRoomCode()   |  The JavaScript function checkRoomCode() first gets the value of the room code input field using the document.getElementById() method. The value property of the getElementById() method returns the value of the element with the specified ID. Next, the function checks if the room code is less than 1, empty, or not an integer using the following conditional statements: roomCode < 1: This checks if the room code is less than 1, roomCode === "": This checks if the room code is empty and isNaN(roomCode): This checks if the room code is not an integer. If any of the above conditions are met, the function displays an alert message that says "Please enter a valid room code". Otherwise, the function calls the checkUsername() function.  |
|  confirmReturn()   |  The JavaScript function confirmReturn() first uses the confirm() method to display a dialog box with the message "Are you sure you want to return? You will lose all progress". The confirm() method returns a boolean value, true if the user clicks the OK button and false if the user clicks the Cancel button. Next, the function checks the value of the ConfRet variable. If ConfRet is true, the function uses the window.location.assign() method to redirect the user to the https://dan-matthews-23.github.io/the-ultimate-virtual-pub-quiz/index.html page. Otherwise, the function does nothing  |
|  getQuestionArray()   |   The JavaScript function getQuestionArray() first gets the question from the connect.results array and sets it to the question variable. The connect.results array is an array of objects that contains the questions and answers for the quiz. The id variable is the index of the current question in the connect.results array. Next, the function sets the text of the question element to the value of the question variable. The question element is an HTML element that displays the question for the quiz. The function also updates the score and question number. The score variable stores the user's current score. The qID variable stores the number of the current question. Finally, the function calls the getAnswerArray() function. The getAnswerArray() function gets the answer choices for the current question and displays them on the page.  |
| retriveNextQuestion()    |   The JavaScript function retriveNextQuestion() first increments the id variable by 1. The id variable is the index of the current question in the connect.results array. Next, the function checks if the id variable is greater than or equal to the length of the connect.results array. If it is, the function displays a game over modal and hides the quiz section. Otherwise, the function calls the increaseQuestionNumber() function to update the question number. The increaseQuestionNumber() function increments the qID variable by 1. The function then calls the getQuestionArray() function to get the question for the next question. The getQuestionArray() function gets the question and answer choices for the current question and displays them on the page. Finally, the function hides the next button to prevent the user from moving to the next question before answering the current question.  |
| getAnswerArray()    | The JavaScript function getAnswerArray() first gets all of the answer elements on the page using the document.querySelectorAll() method. The querySelectorAll() method returns a collection of elements that match the specified selector. Next, the function gets the correct answer and incorrect answers for the current question from the connect.results array. The connect.results array is an array of objects that contains the questions and answers for the quiz. The function then concatenates the correct answers and incorrect answers into a new array. This is done so that the correct answer can be shuffled with the incorrect answers. The function then shuffles the new array using the shuffle() function. The shuffle() function randomly reorders the elements in an array. Finally, the function loops through the answer elements and sets their text, background color, and disabled state. The text of each answer element is set to the corresponding element in the shuffled array. The background color of each answer element is set to white. The disabled state of each answer element is set to false. The confirmAnswer() function is also attached to each answer element so that the user can click on it to submit their answer.    |
| shuffle()    | The JavaScript function shuffle() randomly reorders the elements in an array. The function takes an array as its input and returns the shuffled array. The function works by first getting the length of the array. Then, it loops through the array from the end to the beginning. For each iteration, the function generates a random number between 0 and the current index. The function then swaps the element at the current index with the element at the randomly generated index. This process is repeated until all of the elements in the array have been swapped.    |
|confirmAnswer()    |  The JavaScript function confirmAnswer() is used to submit an answer to a quiz question. The function takes an element as its input and returns nothing. The function works by first decoding the HTML entities in the selected answer and the correct answer. This is done so that the function can compare the two answers without any special characters. Next, the function checks if the selected answer is equal to the correct answer. If it is, the function sets the background color of the selected answer to green and displays a message to the user that they answered correctly. The function also disables all of the answer buttons so that the user cannot change their answer. If the selected answer is not equal to the correct answer, the function sets the background color of the selected answer to red and displays a message to the user that they answered incorrectly. The function also displays the correct answer in orange and disables all of the answer buttons.   |
| increaseScore()    | The JavaScript function increaseScore() is used to increase the score of the user by 10 points. The function takes no input and returns nothing. The function works by first incrementing the score variable by 10. Then, the function sets the text of the scoreCounter element to the new score.    |
| increaseQuestionNumber()    |  The JavaScript function increaseQuestionNumber() is used to increase the question number by 1. The function takes no input and returns nothing. The function works by first incrementing the qID variable by 1. Then, the function sets the text of the questionCounter element to the new question    |
| addHighScore()    | The JavaScript function addHighScore() is used to add a high score to the local storage. The function takes the username, room code, and score as input and returns nothing. The function works by first getting the existing high scores from local storage. If there are no existing high scores, the function creates an empty array. Next, the function generates a unique player ID by incrementing the length of the existing high scores array by 1. The function then creates an object with the following properties: playerID: The unique player ID, playerName: The username of the player, playerHighScore: The score of the player and then playerRoom: The room code of the quiz. The function then pushes the object into the existing high scores array. Finally, the function sorts the existing high scores array in descending order based on the player high scores. The function then saves the sorted high scores array to local storage.    |
| displayHighScore()    |  The JavaScript function displayHighScore() is used to display the high scores in the DOM. The function takes no input and returns nothing. The function works by first getting the existing high scores from local storage. If there are no existing high scores, the function creates an empty array. Next, the function sorts the existing high scores array in descending order based on the player room or player high score, if the player rooms are the same. The function then gets the element that will contain the high scores table. Finally, the function uses the map() method to iterate through the existing high scores array and create a string of HTML code for each high score. The function then sets the inner HTML of the high scores table element to the string of HTML code.   |












 














### Validation and formatting

**Jigsaw validator**

I used W3 School's Jigsaw Validator for my CSS. The validator picked up 2 errors that were relating to a font-weight issue for .main-title and #score. I corrected these errors and ran the validator again, which passed all tests

![CSS Validator](/assets/images/css-validation.png)

I also used Jigsaw for my HTML that picked up 3 warnings that mainly focussed on empty headers, however the indicated points in the code are filled by JavaScript and are not empty in the deployed site, so I have not actioned these warnins. There were 9 errors however that could not be ignored and directly related to DIV closing tags. I rectified these and ran the tests again with no errors being returned. 

For my JavaScript validation I used JsHint. The first test showed 66 errors of varying nature. Of these, 5 of them needed to be fixed, while 61 were warnings showing that I have used methods only available in later versions. I corrected the 5 errors and ran the code again. It passed all tests.


**Formatting**
I've used [Formatter.com](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html) to format my HTML and CSS code.

## Credits

The vast majority of my time spent developing this project was spent by creating code from various sources, adapting, testing and evaluating. At the start of this project I had next to no coding experience. However, one of my skills is to find relevant information from various sources and adapt it to suit my own needs. Apart from one instance, I have not used any code written by others anywhere in this project, but feel it important to note from where I've taken inspiration. 

**W3 Schools**

The vast majority of coding I have learned for this project has come from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com). A few examples of this are [rounded borders](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp), [media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) and [background properties](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background.php). The information and resources are brilliant and have been a major factor in my completing this project.

**Code Pen**

After my mentor advised me to use EventListeners I studied online material to learn how to do this. Code Pen taught me how to sucessfully use EventListners. The article can be found [here](https://codepen.io/mohdizz/pen/VweZBQO)
