  ## The Ultimate Pub Quiz

![Am I responsive](/assets/images/responsive.png)

[View The Ultimate Pub Quiz on Github](https://dan-matthews-23.github.io/java-project/)

The Ultimate Pub Quiz is an exciting development designed specifically for pub users and activity coordiators. Based on the principles of a "traditional Friday night pub quiz", the Ultimate Pub quiz is a way of having that same fun, only without the hastle of organising it. 

## User Experience
### Background

The Ultimate Pub Quiz is designed for pub users and activity coordinators and is a way for all participants to enjoy the same experience of a traditional pub quiz. It's an online quiz that users can access by using a range of devices, although they will be limited to smart devices (e.g. laptops. tablets, smart phones).

This quiz has been developed based on a real need - a good friend who is also a pub landlord  - for an exciting experience without the hastle of having someone try to organise it. 

The quiz has several aims:

- Engage pub users
- Respond to user input
- Provide feedback
- Provide a final score. 
- Display record of previous high scores 

### Key information

- A 'How to play' section, which will give users instructions on how to play the game
- A 'High Scores' section, which will display a list of the highest scores in descending order
- The quiz itself which will allow the users to answer questions

### About the user

This project has been designed with two end users in mind:

- The pub user, who is the user participating in the quiz. They will be able to access the quiz via a smart device through their own internet or Wifi of the premises, if they have it. Part of the 'How to Play' instructions will be guiding users how to switch on their device wi-fi, or hotspot to another device. They will be given a 'Room Number' that they must enter along wth their name when they join the quiz. They will be given the Room ID by the faciltator. The instructions will need to be clear. 

- The facilitator, who is the person who will be facilitating the event. They will need to ensure everyone has the correct Room Code, and they need only advise the participants to begin at an alloted time. Once all participants have completed the quiz, the facilitator will be able to view the High Scores, which will be grouped and easy to identify a clear winner.  

### User Goals
The pub user:

- To receive the same user experience on multiple devices
- To read instructions that are simple to understand
- To be challenged across a range of questions
- To see my score once the quiz is over
- To compare my score with other scores


The facilitator:
- To see the results of the users in the room once finished
- To easily identify a winner amongst users in the room


### First Time Visitor Goals

The pub user:
- To take part in an online virtual pub quiz
- To be challenged in the right way (questions not too easy or too hard) ((!! Will solve this by choosing range of questions from range of topics))
- To view my score at the end, and be able to compare to other scores

The facilitator:
- To view scores of the users without havng to do the quiz myself
- To be able to identify a winner


### Returning Visitor Goals

The pub user:
- To take part in an online virtual pub quiz
- To be challenged in the right way (questions not too easy or too hard) ((!! Will solve this by choosing range of questions from range of topics))
- To view my score at the end, and be able to compare to other scores

The facilitator:
- To view scores of the users without havng to do the quiz myself
- To be able to identify a winner

### Frequent Visitor Goals

The pub user:
- To take part in an online virtual pub quiz
- To be challenged in the right way (questions not too easy or too hard) ((!! Will solve this by choosing range of questions from range of topics))
- To view my score at the end, and be able to compare to other scores

The facilitator:
- To view scores of the users without havng to do the quiz myself
- To be able to identify a winner

### Colour

![THE ULTIMATE QUIZ COLOUR PALETTE](/assets/images/colour-palette.webp)

[Also available as Coolors palette](https://coolors.co/1d110f-a37451-0e0807-8b5f48-67442c)

I have chosen the above colour palette from Coolors which was generated based on the background image I used. However I have slightly modified some of the shades in order to conform with contrast ratio (see #Feedback). 


### Font

 The font I have chosen to use for this project is one called Poppins, which is part of the Sans Sarif family. It can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins). I chose the 'Light 300' weighting as I felt that it would stand out a little more than the 'thin' preset. 

### Images

There is only one image used in the Virtual Pub Quiz which servves as a background image, relevent to the theme. The author is noted and is available to view in the #Credits section.


## Features

### Sections

It's important to note here that the Virtual Pub Quiz is contained on a single page that is seperated out into different sections, each hidden and displayed, or toggled, by the user (see Functions Explained for detail on how the toggle works)

#### User Selection Screen section

![User Selection Screen]()

This is the first section the user is presented with. It has three buttons that, based on user input, will take the user to one of three sections: Username, Instructions or Hall of Fame. 

#### Username section

![User Selection Screen]()

This section is where the user enteres a username and a room code. Both are input boxes and subject to validation to ensure the username is between 3 and 10 characters long, and that the room code is numeric. In practise, the room code will be available from the facilitator. The user can either choose to return to the main menu, or submit the username and room code

#### Quiz section

![User Selection Screen]()

The Quiz section is there the user is asked a question, and is given four possible answers to choose. Only one of them is correct. Guessing the correct answer will cause the score to increment by 10 and the answer being highlighted green, while guessing the incorrect answer will cause the chosen answer being highlighted red, and the correct answer highlighted yellow. Once an answer has been selected, the 'Next' button will appear. Clicking this button will cause the next question to be called from the API. This will continue until the array has reached the question limit. At any time, the user may return to the main menu.

#### Game Over section

![User Selection Screen]()

Once the user has reached the question limit, the questions will no longer display. All sections will hide and the Game Over section will display that will tell the user their final score. The suer will be presented with two options: Return to the main menu, or save their score into the Hall of Fame. 

#### Hall of Fame section

![User Selection Screen]()

The Hall of Fame section lists all saved scores. They are sorted first by Room Number and then by score. By grouping the scores by room number first it makes it easier for the facilitator to see who won the round. The user can then go back to the main menu by selecting the button, and they are taken back to the User Selection Screen section

#### Instructions

![User Selection Screen]()

This section gives the user a set of instructions on how to play the quiz. The user has the option to return to the main menu. 

#### Return to main manu

![User Selection Screen]()

This option is available to the user at every section. When clicked, the suer will be presented with a confirm box, asking the user to confirm they want to go back to the main menu, and that any progress will be lost. The user can either click 'Ok' or 'cancel' to stay on the current section. 


#### Footer




## Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

- Using alternative text for interactive elements within the project
- Using an accessible colour palette
- Using a clear, accesible navigation system throughout that is guided by the user
- Using semantic scripts
- Using a good contrast ratio that passes contrasting tests (see Feedback on previous projects for further infoformation)


## Justifications and reflections

### Justifications

-  **Play Again** -  I had originally intended on creating a Play Again option to be presented ont he Game Over modal. However I decided not to include this function in the final verion of the product due to conflicts with the user story of the facilitator. This was intended to be virtual pub quiz, and in a pub quiz, the participants are not generally allowed to subit their answers twice. Therefore I have not included this option, however it should be noted here that there must be a certain level of trust that the user will not start the quiz again but with a different username, just as there is a level of trust that the participants in a face to face will not confer with one another. To mitigate this risk as much as possible, I have set the question array limit to 100, reducing the likelhood of the same user answering the same questions as before. 

-  **Hall Of Fame list** - In an earlier version of the project I had a function that would allow the user to display all scores either by Room Number or Score by selecting from a drop-down menu and clicking a submit button. However this proved to be complex because I have opted to hide and display sections by class all on one page rather than to use modals. Because of this I could not find a way of executing the function without a submit, and when the button was clicked and the function activated, it reset the classes of every section. Instead, I have a function that sorts the high scores by order of room, then of score automaticly. That means the facilitator user stories are still met, making it easy to see who scored the most out of the room, and the participents user stories are also met by being able to see the top player. While this method was not my preferred way, it still achieves the same thing. 

### Reflections

#### Design

- **Seperate pages for each section** - I did not include a page per section as I'd seen others do whilst doing some research, and as per my original designs. This was purely a choice of personal preference; I wanted to create something unique, and hadn't seen a quiz done on a single page in my research. In hindsight it may have been easier to create this project using seperate pages, particularly for my Hall of Fame section (as described above).

- **Facilitator login system** - Although I did not include these in my original designs, I had hoped to create a login for the facilitator so that they could create a room, then start it when all participants were ready. However after speaking to my friend (the pub owner), they highlighted that while it was a good idea in principal, in application it could prove to cause other issues. For one, it would require that the facilitator always had a live and stable internet connection, always had login details to hand and that they would have the knowledge to create a room. In addition, they highlight concern with the fact that all particpants would need to indicate they were ready before the facilitator started the room, which again assumed that all particpants would be IT-savy and have no internet conenction issues. With all of these points in mind, I decided to ommit that function completley and instead opted for a way in which all user stories would be met and that addressed all these points

- **Lack of multimedia** - I have intentioanlly ommited any additional media from this project for several reasons:

1) As this quiz was designed for a real purpose with a real-world applicaiton, I had to take into account the environment in which it would be used. With that in mind it's very unlikely that the pub user would be able to hear any background sounds due to the background noise generally associated with a pub setting.

2) It would be unreasonable to expect a pub user, who may be sharing an internet connection with all other pub users or on a limited data plan, to watch a video or have a background sound that would increase the bandwitch needed, however small

3) I did not find there was a need for any multimedia, since the user stories are all met without, and was not part of any of the assessment criterea. 

- **Background color** - While this point is relativley minor, I feel it necessary to point out that I did not intend to use brown as a background for the user screen and user screen container, as well as the answer buttons. However the colour palette was suggested by Coolors based on the background image I'd already selected, and because my eyes don't see contrasts and shades well, I felt it important to rely on that suggestion. However it should be noted that I have also taken the advice of [WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/bookmarklet) which advised me that the Coolors palette was not accessible in its current form, and so I have modified the palette slightly so that it passed all tests (see Feedback on previous projects).

- **Difficulty** - 

- **Navigation bar** - I have chosen not to conform to a standard navigation bar that a user would generally expect to find on a typical website. The reasoning behind this is that this project, being a quiz, was designed with the elements in mind that a user would find on almost any interactive quiz, therefore the navigation across the quiz comes from buttons that display the relevent sections.

## Testing

Please see [Testing Readme](/TESTING.md) for all testing for this project


## Feedback

### Peer Feedback

I have worked closely with my peers on testing this product rigorously for any errors. The feedback is as follows:

1) How many questions do you have on your quiz? I've got to four and the game just stops with no errors or alerts

2) When you get correct answer it changes to just 40 then you click next and get score 40, might be better to keep score alongside he number when answer correct.

3) Your scores aren't working when I completed the quiz

4) On your instructions on mobile use overflow: scroll

5) Your back to main menu buttons are giving me a 404 error

6) What happens if there's a draw? Should you not have a bonus round?


### Responding to Peer Feedback

I have taken the following actions in response to feedback:

1) For this particular error I have used a function I found on  [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/decoding-html-entities-with-vanilla-javascript/). It puts the value of the correct answer into a blank text box then pulls it back out in order to format, or decode, the value of the variable. 

2) I have amended the increaseScore function output to return "Score: ${score} rather than just the value of score. 

3) I have re-designed the Game Over modal to include a final high score which is clear

4) I have corrected the issue with main container that was causing the content to spill out 

5) I have ameded the code where ordinarily the user would be directed to ("index.html") which is designed for localhost, not for external hosting

6) Some facilitators allow joint winners in a standard pub quiz. Also, I spoke to my friend (the pub owner) about this who said that facilitators often come prepared with activities, rather than questions, in the event of a tie. With this in mind, I felt it important not to take away that option, and so I have not acted upon this feedback. 


### Feedback from previous projects

I received several peices of feedback on my Heart Helpers project from my facilitarors. These were:

1)  Background and foreground are clear and easy to read however, <u>in the future contrast ratio could be cross check during the design stage. (alt text has been used in the code)</u>

2) There are fewer spaces or capitalisation in the file <u>cross check for future development</u>

3) Clearly evidence the testing process for both unit testing and final usability testing. Test logs are included in the readme file to access functionality, usability and responsiveness. <u>For further development do include screenshots of actual result of tests</u>

4) Learners has presented code is well-organised and easy to follow. The finished project has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing the needs of a particular target audience.  <u>For further development make use of code and screen shots in readme file for development stages</u>

5) Some documentation has been completed throughout development as shown in readme although further and detail documentation is required 

### Responding to feedback from previous projects


I have taken the following actions in response to feedback:

1) Because I am partially colour-blind, I've had to build this project using a tool called (WebAIM)[] to aid me in checking contrast ratio. I continue to use alternative text, however I have also made the following adjustments to my Coolers template. The adjustments pass all validator tests and can be found in the Design section:

- Answer Buttons: Background: #9A6A4C, text: #FFFFFF
![678px ratio](/assets/testing/contrast-ratio-a.png

- Game Over Modal: Background: #1D110F, text: #a37451
![678px ratio](/assets/testing/contrast-ratio-b.png

 - Score Section: Background: #1D110F, text: #a37451
 ![678px ratio](/assets/testing/contrast-ratio-c.png

 I have also included a WAVE report which passes all tests


2) I have ensured that every filename contains no numbers, capital letters or underscores. Each file has been placed in an appropiate folder, and I've ensured each file is named correctly and appropiatly. 

3) I have ensured that along with details of all of my testing, I've included as many before and after screenshots as possible. In some cases it wasn't always possible to include both, but these tests are clearly marked with justification

4) Throughout the testing stages I have included snippets of code along with screenshots of visual output of that code.

### Other Feedback

My mentor - Harry - suggested that instead of creating four seperate HTML documents as planned in my wireframes, that I create one single page and then use Javascript to hide and show the sections I want. To that end, I have created a series of Event Listeners that will execute blocks of code when the correct button is clicked. In this context, it will show/hide parts of the page since the entire product exists in one document. 



## Functions explained

The following section will explain in detail how each function works. All functions can be found in /assets/js/script.js


|      Function   |  Code Snippet                                 | Line   | Explanation    |
| ------------    | ------------                                  | -----  |-----------   |
|  connectAPI()   | async function connectAPI(apiURL)             |        | The 'async' in this function is crutial as it makes the function return a 'promise' |

### Validation and formatting
**Jigsaw validator**

I used W3 School's Jigsaw Validator for my CSS. The validator picked up 53 errors. 25 of these were relating to Bootstrap. However the remaining 28 errors were from my style.css file, overwhelmingly relating to invalid references I'd made (e.g. .header-text-font  Property font-display doesn't exist : block). As the vast majority of my CSS was created through manipulating code and learning the end result, I expected more than a few errors during the first check. There were also 419 warnings flagged, but again these related to Bootstrap and was not something I could fix. I addressed all CSS issues, ran the validator again and it passed all validation with the output: Congratulations! No Error Found. This document validates as CSS level 3 + SVG !

I have also used Jigsaw to validate my HTML code. There were 23 errors identified which mainly covered my 'alt' tags, which I found were placed inappropriately. I resolved all HTML issues and ran the validator again. It showed no further errors. I re-ran the code after I made changes based on feedback from my peers.


**Formatting**
I've used [Formatter.com](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html) to format my HTML and CSS code. I feel it was necessary to use a tool like this after I'd validated it, simply because this is my first project and I am very inexperienced as a developer at this point. I formatted my code again after I made changes to the code following peer feedback.

 ## Future Developments

There are several improvements I would like to make to Heart Helpers in the future when my knowledge and experience are improved.

## Credits

The vast majority of my time spent developing this project was spent by creating code from various sources, adapting, testing and evaluating. At the start of this project I had next to no coding experience. However, one of my skills is to find relevant information from various sources and adapt it to suit my own needs. Apart from one instance, I have not used any code written by others anywhere in this project, but feel it important to note from where I've taken inspiration. 

**W3 Schools**

The vast majority of coding I have learned for this project has come from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com). A few examples of this are [rounded borders](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp), [media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) and [background properties](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background.php). The information and resources are brilliant and have been a major factor in my completing this project.

**Code Pen**

After my mentor advised me to use EventListeners I studied online material to learn how to do this. Code Pen taught me how to sucessfully use EventListners. The article can be found [here](https://codepen.io/mohdizz/pen/VweZBQO)

## Acknowledgments

Finally, I want to take the opportunity to thank and acknowledge the following for their support and patience in helping me create my first ever project:


- Kera Cudmore, whose project gave me the inspiration I needed for my own project, and her useful tips and advice along the way.
- Craig Hudson, who has helped me in this project with testing and for his technical troubleshooting  
- [Harry Dhillon](https://github.com/Harry-Leepz), who is my mentor at the Code Institute, for their continued support and guidance. 
- Kofi Afriyie, who is my facilitator from West Herts College, for their time, patience and encouragement in helping me develop this project. 
- Chris Minnick, who is the author of JavaScript ALL-IN-ONE for dummies (which can be found on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-All-Dummies-Chris-Minnick/dp/1119906830)). It was from Chris that I learned how to connect to an API (lines 70 - 86 in script.js), and I have based my code upon that template. 
- James Q. Quick, whose video (which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFhmNLKwwGw&list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx&index=10)) taught me how to utliize local storage, which was an intregal part of this project
